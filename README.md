## Features
This is fullstack softawre agency project. i have build this site in my leisure time only cool. that's why did'nt have much time added much functionalilty. but in future i will try add here more things.
here i have implement context api for data handling. my plan was using redux or graphql using. but this is only testing project and i have time conflict that's why can't add that features.
